721 Project 1 - Cloud Continuous Delivery of Microservice
[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/Erica233/microservice/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Erica233/microservice/actions/workflows/main.yml)

I created a Microservice in Fast API using AWS App Runner and pushed it onto my Github. It basically implements four simple calculations, add, subtraction, multiplication and divisions.

You can go to the website and see the welcome page, and do calculations:
1.Addition: by appending /add/{num1}/{num2} to the URL to get the sum of num1 and num2.
2.Subtraction: by appending /sub/{num1}/{num2} to the URL to get the result of num1 minus num2.
3.Multiplication: by appending /mul/{num1}/{num2} to the URL to get the multiplication of num1 and num2.
4.Division: by appending /div/{num1}/{num2} to the URL to get the result of num1 divided by num2.
